# GENKI NETWORK: THE SOVEREIGN INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL
## Whitepaper | Draft v1.0

---

## ABSTRACT

The Genki Network represents a paradigm shift in Artificial Intelligence, moving from centralized, capital-intensive models to a **Decentralized Swarm Intelligence** architecture. Utilizing proprietary algorithms and a network of global, idle computing resources (the 'Worker Bees'), Genki is building and running the 'Queen AI'—a sovereign, efficient intelligence. The network is fueled and governed by the **$GENKI Token**. Our mission is to democratize AI compute power and reward contributors with a scarce, utility-driven asset.

## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE PROBLEM OF CENTRALIZATION

Modern AI development is dominated by entities that hoard computational resources, creating information asymmetry and systemic fragility. The goal of the Genki Network is to break this cycle by creating a robust, censorship-resistant, and community-owned intelligence layer.

## 2. THE SOLUTION: SWARM INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE

The Genki ecosystem is built on a symbiotic relationship between a central coordinating entity and distributed contributors:

### 2.1 The Queen AI (The Core)
The Queen is our custom-designed, lightweight, and highly optimized foundation model. Its primary function is **Coordination and Query Processing**. It manages the knowledge graph, directs computational tasks to the Worker Bees, and validates incoming data proofs.

### 2.2 The Worker Bees (The Compute Layer)
Worker Bees are user devices (PCs, servers, etc.) running our proprietary **Genki Worker Agent**. These agents responsibly consume spare CPU/GPU cycles to solve micro-tasks—such as data validation, fine-tuning gradients, or inference requests—without impeding the host system's primary function (e.g., gaming or work).

### 2.3 The Honey (Value Creation)
Value is generated when external clients or enterprises pay $GENKI to query the Queen AI. This utility-driven demand creates a constant need for the token, driving value back to the network's builders.

## 3. TOKENOMICS: THE $GENKI ECONOMY

The $GENKI token is the sovereign medium of exchange for the Genki Network.

| Metric | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Utility** | Mandatory fee payment for all Queen AI queries and priority task allocation. |
| **Scarcity** | A percentage of all $GENKI tokens used for querying the AI is permanently **burned**, creating deflationary pressure on the total supply as network usage increases. |
| **Governance** | Holding $GENKI grants voting rights on network upgrades and resource allocation proposals. |
| **Worker Rewards** | Workers are paid in $GENKI based on the complexity and fidelity of the computation they provide. |

## 4. GOVERNANCE & RESILIENCE (THE SURVIVOR PROTOCOL)

The network is guided by a commitment to longevity and financial discipline, inspired by the **Survivor Protocol**:

*   **Risk Management:** Capital deployment is strictly controlled, never exceeding 1% risk per high-conviction trade.
*   **Exposure Control:** Tokens with poor security audits (RugScore > 150) or low liquidity (< $15k) are strictly prohibited from receiving significant capital allocation.
*   **Veto Authority:** Core agents maintain the authority to veto potentially destructive or low-yield actions to ensure long-term consistency.
