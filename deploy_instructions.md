# Deploying $GENKI to Solana Devnet (Hustler Instructions)

This guide explains how to deploy our first technical version of the $GENKI Token.

### 1. Requirements
*   **Solana CLI:** Installed on the host.
*   **Anchor Framework:** For building and deploying the contract.
*   **Wallet:** We will use the existing `FBjiZQaKhkg172gnJsBUhsDixh8EaxHxwnqLEGFcJZWR`.

### 2. Steps to Deploy (Devnet)
1.  **Set Network:**
    `solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com`
2.  **Get Test SOL:**
    `solana airdrop 2` (Repeat until you have enough for deployment fees).
3.  **Build Contract:**
    `anchor build`
4.  **Deploy:**
    `anchor deploy`
5.  **Initialize:**
    Once deployed, we call the `initialize_genki` function to set the supply.

### 3. Monitoring
After deployment, the Token ID will be added to our site `genki-network.pages.dev` and the `Hustler-Memory` repository.
